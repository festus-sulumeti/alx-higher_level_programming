Python Inheritance
Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows us to create new classes from existing classes. The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class, which can save us time and effort in coding.

In Python, a class that is inherited from another class is called a derived class or child class. The class that is being inherited from is called the base class or parent class.
