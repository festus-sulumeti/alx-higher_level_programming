Python Input/Output

This document describes how to take input from the user and how to output data in Python.

Input
The input() function is used to take input from the user. It takes a prompt as an optional argument. The prompt is displayed on the screen before the user is prompted to enter input.


The user will be prompted to enter an integer. The input will be stored in the variable num.

The input() function always returns a string. If you want to convert the input to a different data type, you can use the appropriate typecasting function. For example, the following code converts the input to an integer

Output
The print() function is used to output data. It takes one or more objects as arguments. The objects are printed to the console, separated by spaces by default.
