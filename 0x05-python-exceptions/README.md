Python Exceptions

Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a Python program that disrupt the normal flow of the program.
They can be caused by a variety of errors, such as trying to divide by zero, accessing a nonexistent variable, or calling a function with invalid arguments.

When an exception occurs, the Python interpreter stops executing the current line of code and looks for an exception handler.
 An exception handler is a block of code that is executed when an exception occurs.
