0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. In this project, we will learn about the following:

Sets
Dictionaries
1. How to use sets and dictionaries in Python
2. How to solve problems using sets and dictionaries

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. meaning no element can appear in a set more than once. 
They(sets)are often used to represent things like the collection of letters in a word, or the collection of numbers in a range.

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. meaning  each element in a dictionary has a unique key, and the value associated with that key can be anything.
They(Dictionaries) are often used to represent things like a phone book, or a list of groceries.

In the project, one learns how to use sets and dictionaries to solve a variety of problems:

1. Find the intersection of two sets
2. Find the union of two sets
3. Check if a number is in a set
4. Add an element to a set
5. Remove an element from a set
6. Look up a value in a dictionary
7. Add a key-value pair to a dictionary
8. Remove a key-value pair from a dictionary
